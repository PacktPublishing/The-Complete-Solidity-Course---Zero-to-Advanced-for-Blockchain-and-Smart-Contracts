/*    Inheritance!

Inheritance is a way to extend functionality of a contract. 
Solidity supports both single as well as multiple inheritance. Following are the key highlighsts.

Observe: The contract in Solidity is similar to a Class in C++ - a blueprint for an object 

Classes can inherit and so can contracts!

    Constructor âˆ’ A special function declared with constructor keyword which will be 
    executed once per contract and is invoked when a contract is created.
    
    Exercise Create two contracts A and B
    1. Contract A should have a state var called innerVal initialized to 100.
    2. Create a  fully accessible function called innerAddTen which returns 10 to any given input
    3. Contract B should inherit from contract A 
    4. Contract B should have a function called outerAddTen which returns 
    the calucaltion from innerAddTen function in Contract A to any given input
    5. Create a function in contract B which returns the value of innerVal from contract A
*/


contract A {
    uint innerVal = 100;
    // constant 
    function innerAddTen(uint val) public pure returns (uint) {
        return val + 10;
    } 
    
}

// is means inherit from 
contract B is A {
        function outerAddTen(uint val) public pure returns (uint) {
            return A.innerAddTen(val);
        }
        
        function getInnerVal() public view returns(uint) {
            return A.innerVal;
        } 
}
