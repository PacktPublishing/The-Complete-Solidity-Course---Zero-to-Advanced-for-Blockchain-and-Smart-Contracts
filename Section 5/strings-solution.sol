// Solidity supports String literal using both double quote (") and single quote ('). 
// It provides string as a data type to declare a variable of type String.

// visible or invisible, and characters may be repeated.

    //4 . create a function which changes the favoriteColor string literal from blue to your favorite color.
    //5 . create a function which can return how many characters there are in the string favorite color
