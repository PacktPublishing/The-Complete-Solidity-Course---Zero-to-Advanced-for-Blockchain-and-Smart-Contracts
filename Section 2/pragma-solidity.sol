pragma solidity >= 0.7.0 < 0.9.0;

// Exercise: 1. Create a new solidity file called exercise-assignment 
// 2. Instantiate the version solidity of 0.5.0 
// 3. Bonus: increase the range of the version from 0.5.0 up to 0.6.3

// we are specifying the compiler version of solidity ranging and including from
// 0.7.0 up to and not including 0.9.0

// >= means greater than or equal to...
// < less than sign..

// If we want to write solidity code we first create a new file and assign the type of data file with .sol

// Pragma is generally the first line of code within any Solidity file. 
// pragma is a directive that specifies the compiler version to be used for current Solidity file. 
// Solidity is a new language and is subject to continuous improvement on an on-going basis.


// Solidity: Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It was influenced by C++,  
// Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
